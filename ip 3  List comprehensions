# Function to convert heights from inches to centimeters using list comprehension
def ConvertHeightscompreshion(heights):
    # List comprehension to convert each height in the 'heights' list from inches to centimeters (1 inch = 2.54 cm)
    # round() is used to round each conversion to two decimal places.
    return [round(height * 2.54, 2) for height in heights]

# Main function to interact with the user
def main():
    # Ask the user to input heights in inches, separated by spaces
    # input() reads the input as a string
    # split() splits the string by spaces, turning it into a list of strings
    # map(float, ...) converts each string in the list into a float (to handle decimal values)
    # list() converts the map object into a list of floats
    heights = list(map(float, input("Enter heights (in inches) separated by spaces: ").split()))
    
    # Call ConvertHeightscompreshion to convert the heights in inches to centimeters
    cm_heights = ConvertHeightscompreshion(heights)
    
    # Print the converted heights in centimeters
    print(f"Converted Heights in cm: {cm_heights}")

# Call the main function to run the program
main()
output: Enter heights (in inches) separated by spaces: 56 65 76 87
Converted Heights in cm: [142.24, 165.1, 193.04, 220.98]
